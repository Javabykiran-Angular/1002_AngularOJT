1 Simple Pgm
	demo1.ts
	console.log("Hello world");
	console.log('...')
	console.log(`...`);
	tsc demo1.ts & node demo1.js
	
2 variables
	var a1;
	
3 data types
	- number(int short float double,long),string(''/""),boolean,any(number,string,boolean),misc=>null & undefined => data type as well as value ,void
	
	var a:number=10;
	console.log(`,jbd,zhfb ${a} `);
	
	var str!:string;
var a=52;
	
	
4 literal
	var a:number|string;
	
	var a:52|boolean;
	
5 type assertion

	 var a:any 
	 
	 1 Angle bracket
		var temp=(<string> a);
		
	2 as syntax
		var temp=(a as string)
